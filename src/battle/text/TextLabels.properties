description=\nThe object of Battleship is to try and sink all of the other player's before they sink all of your ships.\nAll of the other player's ships are somewhere on his/her board.\nYou try and hit them by calling out the coordinates of one of the squares on the board.\nThe other player also tries to hit your ships by calling out coordinates.\nNeither you nor the other player can see the other's board so you must try to guess where they are.\nGOOD LUCK !
